# PopularMovies2

## About 
Project 3 Udacity Android Developer Nandegree. The App queries TheMovieDb API to retrieve data using Retrofit.
To create this app, I applied Architecture Components: MVVM, Dependency Injection with Dagger 2, LiveData, DataBinding.
In addition, I added an animation when the RecyclerView is scrolled up and down and implemented a Dual Pane version for tablets.

**Features:**

- Query Most Popular and Top Rated Movies
- Search for Movies
- Watch Trailers
- Read Overview and Reviews
- Save Favourite Movies on the phone
- Optime for tablet in Dual Pane mode
